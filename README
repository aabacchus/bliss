Why Lua?
--------

Lua ...
 - shares many goals with KISS, such as simplicity and efficiency.
 - offers advantages over shell as a "proper" programming language.
 - can easily be extended by code written in C (etc).
 - is relatively fast.

Dependencies
------------

Lua 5.4
lua-posix library (https://github.com/luaposix/luaposix)
BLAKE3 C library (https://git.sr.ht/~mcf/b3sum) (built with -fPIC)

Rationale: plain Lua lacks UNIX-specific bindings which we need (working with
files and paths) so either I would write a set of Lua bindings to C, but it's as
simple to use an existing set such as lua-posix.
